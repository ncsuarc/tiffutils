[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ncsuarc/tiffutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ncsuarc/tiffutils)

Various TIFF utility functions.

This module provide various functionality for working with TIFF files that
is not available in other modules.

Currently, the primary functionality is the ability to load and save RAW
Bayer images to and from DNGs and Numpy ndarrays.

## Requirements

* python-dev
    * This is a Python C API module, so the Python headers are required
    * Python 2 and Python 3 are supported
    * Tested on Python 3.6+
* libtiff-dev > 4.0.3
    * libtiff with support for CFA (color filter array) tags is required
    * Support is merged into the libtiff trunk, and will be released with
      the version of libtiff following 4.0.3.
    * A patch for libtiff 4.0.3 is included as libtiff-4.0.3.patch
    * The latest version can be downloaded from the
      [libtiff website](http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/).

## Building and installing

First ensure that you have libtiff > 4.0.3.  If not, you need to configure,
build, and install a newer version.  The CVS trunk already includes the required
CFA tag support, so it can be used directly. Otherwise, download libtiff 4.0.3,
apply the included patch, and configure, build, and install libtiff.

    $ cd /path/to/libtiff
    $ patch -p1 < /path/to/tiffutils/libtiff-4.0.3.patch

Once all dependencies are met, it is simple to build and install the module:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, for Python 3:

    $ python3 setup.py install

Of course, if the installation location requires root permissions, `sudo` may
be necessary.

## Tests

The `test/` directory contains module unit tests, which can be run using tox.
For most users, the following commands should work. However, the tests do
require the libraries Boost.Python and Exiv2 to be installed, so check for that
if you run into issues.

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox
